# Software CFG Degree Resources (summer 2023)

3. Create a New Branch<br>
   Create a new branch to work on your contributions. It's a good practice to create a branch dedicated to a specific feature or resource you're adding. You can create a new branch using the following command:

After committing your changes, push the branch to your GitHub repository:

```
git push origin your-branch-name
```

6. Create a Pull Request<br>
   When you're ready to share your contributions with the community, navigate to the original repository on GitHub and create a pull request. Provide a clear title and description of your changes, so other collaborators can understand the purpose of your contribution.

7. Review and Merge<br>
   Other collaborators will review your pull request, provide feedback, and suggest any necessary changes. Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main repository, and your contributions will be visible to everyone.
